\section{Conclusion}
We reduced the time to compute all $N$ proofs in the Pointproofs vector commitment scheme from $O(N^2)$ time to $O(N\log{N})$.
The key ingredient was representing the proof computation as a product between a Toeplitz matrix and a vector, which can be computed fast via Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) on group elements.

We thank Leonid Reyzin for suggesting to look at Pointproofs from the lens of polynomial commitments, which inspired the author to devise this technique for computing all proofs fast!
