\section{Introduction}

Gorbunov et al.~\cite{GRWZ20} introduced \textit{Pointproofs}, an elegant vector commitment (VC) scheme which enhances the Libert-Yung VC~\cite{LY10} with \textit{subvector} proofs and (cross)aggregation of proofs.
Pointproofs was originally proposed for stateless validation in cryptocurrencies with smart contracts, where each contract is allocated a small memory of $N=1000$ locations that can be committed to using the Pointproofs VC.
In subsequent work, Leung et al.~\cite{LGG+20} build an authenticated dictionary called \textit{Aardvark} on top of the Pointproofs VC.
We stress that both applications benefit immensely from faster proof computation.
First, for stateless validation, larger contract memories can be used if proofs can be computed faster.
Second, for Aardvark, committing to the dictionary can be sped up by computing all proofs faster.
Lastly, we observe that our proof precomputation for Pointproofs is \textit{concretely} faster than the proof precomputation in other bilinear-based VCs~\cite{TAB+20}, which could make Pointproofs better suited for stateless validation in cryptocurrencies.
